Current
======
I am an MRes/PhD student at the London School of Economics and Political Science, affiliated with the Department of Government and the Grantham Research Institute. I am interested in studying: 
* distributional impacts of climate change
* electoral institutions 
* policy advocacy and lobbying
* just transitions and sustainable employment


Background 
======
I have previously worked in the OECD's Directorate on Employment, Labour and Social Affairs (2017-2019, 2021-2022), at the European Commission's DG Competition (2020-2021), and at the Wilson Center (2016). I have a B.A. in Global Affairs from Yale, and an MSc in Global Governance and Diplomacy from Oxford.
