#Current
I am an MRes/PhD student at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
Within the Department of Government and the Grantham Research Institute, I am interested in: 
* distributional impacts of climate change
* electoral institutions 
* policy advocacy and lobbying
* just transitions and sustainable employment

I have previously worked in the OECD's Directorate on Employment, Labour and Social Affairs (2017-2019, 2021-2022), at the European Commission's DG Competition (2020-2021), and at the Wilson Center (2016).
